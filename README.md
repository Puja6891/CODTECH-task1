STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Overview
The Student Management System is a simple C-based program designed to manage student records efficiently. This program allows for the registration, maintenance, and management of student data, including adding, editing, and deleting student information. It also includes functionality to calculate and display grades based on student marks.

Key Features:
Add Student: Register new students with basic information and marks for multiple subjects.
Edit Student: Modify existing student records, including updating personal details and academic scores.
Delete Student: Remove student records from the system.
Calculate Grades: Automatically calculate and assign grades based on average marks across subjects.
Display Students: View a list of all registered students, along with their details, academic scores, and calculated grades.
This system is an excellent foundation for understanding basic data management in C, providing a hands-on experience with arrays, structures, and user interaction in a console application.
